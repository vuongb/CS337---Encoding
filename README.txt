PROJECT TITLE: CS337 - Project0 - Encoding
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This program takes a input file and encodes it into an output file. Each input string is converted to a binary representation, the amount of 1s are counted in the binary representation and if (1) the amount is odd, a 1 is appended or (2) the amount is even, a 0 is appended to the front of the binary input string. This is then parsed using Integer.parseInt(string, 2) and this value is outputted to the output file.
